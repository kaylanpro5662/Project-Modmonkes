# Project Modmonkes
This is Project ModMonkes, a copy of the Game 'Gorilla Tag'. However, this comes with preinstalled mods and its own lobby system. This is a perfect game, since you can hang out with your friend, while exploring different types of cool mods!

## Boring Backstory Cuz I can

I Created this game because I saw everyone else making and publishing games, like Another Axiom Making Gorilla Tag, and Jman make Shmackle. This was a great opportunity for me to make a VR game, since I had always wanted to make one. So, I followed a couple of Tutorials, and made my game.

## Extra Notes:
